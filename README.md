## Welcome to Margarita's Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my Portfolio. I'm a freelance UX/UI designer based in Zurich. I thrive to develop creative designs for digital products that are user friendly and satisfying both for the client and the users.
My background in architecture has trained me to understand client requirements, to focus on functionality and usability, and to create high quality designs that are both visually and functionally appealing.
I prefer an agile-based design methodology, continuously optimizing the product from the first idea sketches to the front-end development. I enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams and Iâ€™m always looking forward to learn something new.
