      this mobile app is a response to my personal experience with existing hiking apps and the wish to know more about the nature around me while hiking. i have found myself seeing an interesting plant or tree and wanting to learn more about it. the challenge was bringing both demands together: hiking maps + vegetation highlights. the app relies on the contributions of other users to share their knowledge and experience and proof the accuracy of the information.

      in order to understand what people would expect from such an app, i undertook interviews with friends and family that enjoy hiking. i also analysed similar apps, some of which already offer hiking maps highlighting plants and trees along the trails. many hiking apps already rely on large hikers communities that contribute with information about existing trails or adding new ones, which corroborated that building such a community is realistic and even welcomed by users.

      i created a sitemap as a basic principle to build on. this helped to develop lo-fi wireframes and refine the app structure and navigation. i decided to focus on the hiking map from the start, offering some simple navigation and filters. the trail description pages and vegetation cards are available through links on the map. the user can either search trails around a specific area or use gps to find his current position and chose trails around him.

      the typography of the logotype is meant to represent the character of the app. it is playful and lively, with natural strokes and a leaf in place of the firse “a” indicating the content of the app. the maps are black and white (or greyscale), highlighting the chosen trail.

    <div class="text1">
      i decided to make the header green (hint: vegetation) and the rest of the color palette consist of complimentary bright colors. the design of the buttons is simplistic, and the content on one page is kept to a minimum to make the experince effortless while hiking.
