      <p>i decided to focus on zurich, the city i live in and know farely well. the i started with an analysis of the food trends in the city and the exisiting restaurants that offer delivery service. the demand on fresh and healthy fast food is growing rapidly, aswell as the number of asian takeaway restaurants that aim white collar workers. i concluded that a momos restaurant would suit the purpose and the current demands. </p>

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>the customizable manu is based on an analysis of the competition. after these fundamental decisions i continued to develope possible userâ€™s personas to identify the target audience and subsequently the character of the website. the next step was to develop a site map and flow map to define the navigation structure of the website. it was important to make the ordering sequence as fast and fluent as possible.</p>

      <p>i created a logotype that identifies with the origin of the momos - nepal. the nepalese writing is often characterized by horizontal lines that connect the elements in a word, which i used as inspiration. the color palette develops from a mood board created with pictures from nepalese landscapes, towns or characteristic food.</p>
