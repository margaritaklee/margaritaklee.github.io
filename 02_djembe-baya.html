      <p>baya contacted me with the request to design a website for his djembe courses in the area of geneva / lausanne. he also wanted to use the website as a plattform to expose himself as a djembe player from burkina faso and to invite people to join him in workshops and concerts. it turns out, there are a lot of djembe and african drums instructors in the area, so the challenge was to stand out and be more appealing that the competition.</p>

      <p><b>methodology</b><br>
        research: user flow testing, analysis of competition<br>
      	design: lo-fi wireframes, clickable mockups<br>
      	tools: adobe cc, flowmapp, invision, figma</p>

    process

  <div class="text-container">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>the first step for this project was to get information about the djembe, its origin and cultural characteristics. i arranged a photoshooting with baya to get some pictures for the website. after analysing the websites from other djembe instructors, i decided to make a website with a straightforward structure, with the purpose of making the experience effortless and not overwhelming with too much information.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>thinking as a person interested in taking a course, there are very specific questions that came to mind: where is the course? - how much does it cost? - when is it? - who is the instructor? - how can i participate?<br> 
      answering these questions in a short but precise manner was imperative, and facilitating the process of registration for a course was the primary goal.</p>

    creation

  <div class="text-container">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>i chose a color palette inspired by typical west african colors - red, green, yellow. i decided that the website should be vibrant and stimulate emotions connected to djembe rythms and music. the pages may vary in color but the main design is constant throughout the entire website. </p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>the character of the website also aims to represent bayaâ€™s personality: lively, cheerful, expressive. i created simple icons for each course category and chose large and bright buttons for a more pictographic interface. the text is brief but sufficient and the contact forms are kept to a minimum.</p>
