      the project focuses on creating a website that presents all current and future exhibitions in zurich. the project aims at people looking for cultural activities in museums in a compact and clearly laid out plattform. the goal is to facilitate the search for exhibitions by date and topic. it is also a useful website for people visiting zurich and planing their activities in the city. the website connects directly to external museum’s or exhibition’s websites for more detailed information.

   there is no interest in profiting from the website, but rather offer a service and promote culture.<br><br>

      it was esencial to analyse already existing websites with similar purpose and content. through visiting the websites it was clear that the ammount of information was to some extent overwhelming. for the purpose of the project, i decided to keep the overview page as clean as possible, with just the necesary information for the user the decide to continue reading on specific element. all exhibitions are organized in a compact grid as elements. 
    </div>
      
    <div class="text1">
      the grid allows a full overview off all exhibitions, including those filtered when such applied. i chose to set the calendar and topic on top of the page as filter elements to make the navigation simple and straightforward. each element leads to the exhibition’s description page, which then leads to the external page. the user flow was tested on both desktop and mobile to optimize the navigation.

      the design of the webpage is kept clean and in black and white so that that the exhibition’s illustrations stand out as the important content. the eye should focus on the content while the background and header are only secondary. when filters are applied, the whole layout stays the same, but the filtered content is higlighted and the unwanted content fades away.
    </div>
      
    <div class="text1">
      this decision is made to simplify the usability of the webpage. the content on the mobile version is presented on a horizontally scrollable grid. contrary to the desktop website, the content adapts to the filters and only the chosen exhibitions are shown, making the experience more suitable for small screens.
